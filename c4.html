   			<h1>C4</h1>

   			<p class="lead">This is my C4 assignment. It was focused entirely on expanding my personal brand. 
                   In fact, you are currently looking at the end product; 
                   the website. Each aspect of how my process lined up with 
                   the C4 is listed below.</p>   			

           </div>
           
           <!-- C1 -->
           <h2>C1: The QBQ</h2>
           <p>This was the hardest step of the C4 assignment for me. I knew that I wanted to focus on my personal brand, but I wasn’t quite sure of how to narrow it down. The first question was simple: How can I make my personal brand better?. This didn’t feel right to me, It was too broad, too vague, not quite explaining what I wanted to achieve. After several iterations, I settled on my QBQ: How can I make my personal brand more memorable?. Now this one was still pretty broad; There’s plenty of ways to make a personal brand memorable. Something that is memorable is not necessarily good. It is simply something that remains in one’s head for a while. But this brought me to my C2.
            </p>

            <!-- C2 -->
           <h2>C2: Silence the VOJ</h2>
           <p>I was worried about the possibility that my personal brand would be remembered for all the wrong reasons. “What if it’s so bad that whoever interviews me goes to tell all their professional buddies not to hire me?”. “What if they can’t even understand what my brand is?”. “What if I decide to completely change my brand later on?”. It took some doing, but eventually I sat down and got to work ideating. I needed to think about what all goes into a personal brand.
            </p>

            <!-- C3 -->
           <h2>C3: Risk</h2>
           <p>Personal brands aren’t outright risky things. You might have a certain action that you take or a way that you carry yourself that defines your brand, but those actions aren’t inherently risky. However, by using those actions on someone else, you put yourself at the risk of being critiqued and judged. This was exactly what I wanted to do, if only to validate my own VOJ by hearing harsh words from others. It’s not that I wanted to fail so much as I wanted to stop living in a world of “what ifs”. So I decided that my brand would be implemented in the most public way possible; a website. Not only that, but I’d share my site via social media and friends to get the word out about my potential disaster. This is the riskiest thing I have ever personally done, and I’m still awaiting my results.</p>

            <!-- C4 -->
           <h2>C4: Fail</h2>
           <p>The failure in all this is hard to determine right now, and I’ll be sure to come back to this site with an update as soon as something changes. The failure could take form in many ways: a bad grade on the portfolio that this C4 represents, a review provided by someone on twitter or linkedIn, or possibly harsh words from a close friend. Until then, I’ll be awaiting the crits needed to further my growth of my personal brand.
            </p>

            <!-- Iterations -->
            <h2>Iterations</h2>
            <p>I’ve placed a slideshow below with screenshots of my website as I added new features and designs. This is my way of showing my iterations and ideation process. I’ve also included pictures of any notes, sketches, and sticky pads that helped make my website a reality.
